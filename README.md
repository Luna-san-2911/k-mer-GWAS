# k-mer-GWAS

Hola! Hi!

This repository was built as a guide to run k-mer based GWAS.
It requires as inputs: short-reads data, phenotype data, ploidy info, and sequencing depth per sample.
As output you will get of course the k-mer based GWAS manhattan plot and other files that could be useful (i.e. k-mer matrix, k-mer-vcf).

This pipeline is based on K-meria (https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7347406/v1) + some issues fixed that I found while running the pipeline + extra scripts and notes

Enjoy!

# Preparing the input files

1. Short-reads
   
3. Phenotype
4. Ploidy
5. Sequencing depth
